This is a Twitter clone created using React to mimic the basic design and functionality of the Twitter app with some redesign. It uses MongoDB for the database. For user authentication, I use the package Passport for the user sign-up and sign-in. Socket.io is used for implementing real-time messaging between the users.

Features include:
Feature 1: Post a tweet
Feature 2 See other's tweets on your timeline
Feature 3: Realtime messaging with Socket.io
Feature 4: User Authentication using passport.js
Feature 5: Check your profile and the post you add and also check the users you follow.
